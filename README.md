Title/Description of game:

Connect 4/C4

A game where each player gets a finite amount of pieces that together equal the amount of cells in the game board, winner is determined by the first person to get 4 pieces in a row, vertically or diagonally and players alternate turns. I chose this game because I used to play connect 4 a lot and it'll be cool to have my own version of it and update it as I go a long

Future enhancements:

I tihnk it would be interesting to determine who gets to go first based on rock paper scissors kinda how my friends and I would sometimes because usually whoever goes first is most likely to win, or maybe do a coin toss. I'd love to do sound effects for pieces going in and animations for wins, loses, and ties, a change of theme option would also be something I'd want to do as well as an option to track a game of 3, 5 or 7, I am also thinking of maybe going with C4 and the piece that determine the win when it's clicked in the winning cell maybe an explosion effect happens, computer player with easy medium hard option
