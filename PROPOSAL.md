Connect 4

## Project Description 

My app is called Connect 4. It's a game app for players who want to go one on one with their friends. Score will be kept automatically and results will be displayed showing who won, lost or if there was a tie. Players will have the option to restart. I am also thinking of having a best of 3, 5, and 7 options depending on how long it takes me to put together the actual game. In the future I'll add that feature if I'm not able to and also a change of background option and sound effects with some win, lose and tie animation.
